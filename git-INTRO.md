Hi, Iâ€™m @mb-svea ðŸ‘‹
I am here as technical assistant for mobilsicher.de. It's a german information platform aimed at the average consumer with tips on smartphone security and sustainability, funded by the federal ministry (BMUV).
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m here to contribute to the open source project endoflife.date, which we rely on to show support dates for smartphone devices in our latest project HandyHelfer.
handy-helfer.de is a low-level website designed to help consumers making sustainable decisions concerning smartphones, e.g. repair, donate, long-time usage.

Looking forward to collaborate âœ¨
